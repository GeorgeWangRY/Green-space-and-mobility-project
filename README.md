This repository contains the code and part of the data to reproduce the tables and figures of Wang et al. "Green space exposure and active transportation during the COVID-19 pandemic: A global analysis using Apple mobility data".

The script "Code" reproduces tables 1 and 2 of the main paper and Figure S4 of the Supplementary Material.
The xls "Data" contains the green space and other data. The Apple data can be accessed through https://covid19.apple.com/mobility, but we do not have permission to share it.
If you have questions regarding the code or data, or have questions about the analysis pipeline we used in general, please contact rw24347@essex.ac.uk.
